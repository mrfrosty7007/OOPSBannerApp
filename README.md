# OOPS Banner App

## Overview

The OOPS Banner App is a Java application that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts step-by-step.

The application starts by displaying "OOPS" in the console and then extends to display it in Banner Format using '*' and spaces. The code is then refactored using functions, a class to store character patterns, and a Map to dynamically render the banner.
